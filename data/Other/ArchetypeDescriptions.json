  "Light": "Light decks are full of slightly rare but strong cards. They aim to control their opponents' plays until nothing remains but forfeitting. A true joy to play as; a true pain to play against.",
  "Persian Space Birds": "Birds from space. These Avian Aliens are all about coordinated efforts to defeat their enemies. Use them in combination to crush anyone who opposes the space army.",
  "None": "Select a card pack to read more about it.",
  "Basic": "Basic cards to start a deck with. Their true purpose is to make all other cards look good by comparison.",
  "Fruit": "The Fruit archetype is perfect for the player who wants to shut their brain off and spam strong but simple cards. The Berry Brother cards are the rarest and most powerful of the bunch.",
  "Quepland": "The Quepland Archetype is built around forcing their opponent into long, tedious grinds to make any progress. Most of the strongest cards are rarer than the average deck, but there are many of them.",
  "Writing Utensils": "The Writing Utensils archetype is always ready to draw out games into long, run on affairs. There are very few cards of this archetype, so you'll probably want to pair it with another control archetype.",
  "Periodic Elements": "Periodic Elements are made for combination plays, with each card complementing another of the archetype. Build some molecules and your opponent will crumble before your molecular might.",
  "Shapes": "Shapes are a simple, quick deck type designed to defeat the opponent before they have time to react. They come in 2D and 3D forms, with the 3D cards being rarer and more powerful."
